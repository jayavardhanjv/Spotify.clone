In a music player you might seen we add songs to a list and while playing those songs which you have put on list the music player follows either one of the order i.e the song which you have put most recent to a music player will be played then the second recent and it goes on till the last one or it can go in other way i.e the song which you have put first to the list will play first and goes for the second one and it goes on till the last one. In our project we will be using stack to demonstrate  for the former mentioned feature and queue for the latter mentioned feature.
